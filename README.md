Story Map SDK 2
=========================

## Overview

The Story Map APP shows all of the high level themes (Features) your users need to do, broken down 
into the smaller stories (User Stories) a user would do as part of each theme.  
See [this](http://www.agileproductdesign.com/blog/the_new_backlog.html) blog post on 
Story Maps by Jeff Patton for more information.

## How to Use

It is recommended that you setup a separate Rally Project for each Story Map. You can then create
Features and stories from the APP as well as create Releases as you start sequencing the stories. Once complete,
you can then move/assign each feature and story to the appropriate team (Project).

### Running the App

If you want to start using the app immediately, create an Custom HTML app on your Rally dashboard. 
Then copy App.html from the deploy folder into the HTML text area. That's it, it should be ready 
to use. See [this](http://www.rallydev.com/help/use_apps#create) help link if you don't know how 
to create a dashboard page for Custom HTML apps.

Or you can just click [here](https://raw.github.com/RallyRonnie/StoryMap2/master/deploy/App.html) to find 
the file and copy it into the custom HTML app.

### Using the App
You can select the "+ Add Feature/Story", then select Feature to add a theme (Column) for your project. You
can then add Stories in the same manor and drag-n-drop to the appropriate Feature and Release. You might need
to refresh the page when adding Releases to see them on the board.
